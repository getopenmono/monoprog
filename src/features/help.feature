	To know how to use the application
	As a maker
	I want the application to display a usage summary when invoked with no arguments.

		When I run `monoprog`
		Then the output should contain "Usage:"
		And the exit status should be 1

		And the exit status should be 0

		Examples:

		When I run `monoprog <arg>`
